"""Sublab Easy - a course-registration chatbot, and the bill it runs up.

Two lessons live in this file, and neither is the chatbot.

The first is that OpenRouter speaks the OpenAI wire format, so the *same client
library* reaches both providers. Look at how little differs between the two
client functions below.

The second is what a "conversation" actually is. The model remembers nothing.
Every turn you resend the entire history, so the input token count climbs on
every turn while your questions stay the same length. You are going to watch
that happen and put the numbers in a table. Week 4 is about what to do once
that becomes a problem.

Fill in every `TODO`. Keep the function signatures - the other sublabs import
from this file, and the examples in the docstrings say what each one must
return.
